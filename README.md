Project from 365DataSciencex.com

Case Description

By undertaking this Excel project you will get the chance to apply crucial analysis techniques for any organization boasting a comprehensive range of products. Leverage Excel pivot tables and slicers to create a report that gives 360-degree visibility of business performance. Management needs this type of analysis to understand how different brands, package types, package sizes, and stock keeping units performed over time. This is an optimal way to track performance and monitor industry trends as a whole, allowing to drill down and uncover detailed insights at lower breakdown levels.

Get ready as this Excel project will challenge your data preprocessing skills, as well as your proficiency when it comes to working with Excel pivot tables. You will work with real-world FMCG data to obtain a well-structured report that gives flexibility to decision-makers, empowering them to scrutinize performance.

The Manufacturer Performance in the Baby Care Market Excel project is suitable for intermediate and advanced students. 

Instructions:

Data preprocessing
In the Baby_Care_source.xlsx file, seek out and eliminate any blank rows lacking recorded volume and value data for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. Investigate the dataset and carry out any additional preprocessing necessary to construct a comprehensive report. This report should enable you to examine sold volumes and revenue at various levels such as manufacturer, brand, package type, product attributes, and package size.

Primary report table structure
Your task is to create the structure of a primary report table. This table should display the Value and Volume data of all manufacturers for 2022, 2023, along with the Year-To-Date (YTD) data for 2024. Furthermore, the table should incorporate a column to represent the average price, which is calculated by dividing the value by the volume.

Fill in the report
Construct a pivot table that will act as the data source for your primary report table. This requires finding a method to extract the requisite information from the pivot table in order to populate the primary report table.

Insert slicers
Insert pivot table slicers that allow you to filter for:

package type
package size
product attributes
Align the slicers layout with the design of the primary report table.
